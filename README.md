## Mohammad Tuqan and Maurizio Porfiri

### Experimental trajectories are provided in the "Experiments" folder for five fish swimming in group with one fish treated for different caffeine concentrations: 0, 25, 50, and 70 mg/L. The "Insilico_videos" folder contain a sample simulation video for each concentration generated using the proposed and calibrated model.
