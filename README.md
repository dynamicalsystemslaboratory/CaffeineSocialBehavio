# Mathematical modeling of zebrafish social behavior in response to acute caffeine administration
## Mohammad Tuqan and Maurizio Porfiri

#### Experimental trajectories used in model calibration and validation are provided in the "Experiments" folder. Each trial corresponds to the trajectories of five fish swimming in group with one fish treated with caffeine. The experiments were conducted for four different caffeine concentrations: 0, 25, 50, and 70 mg/L. Representative animated videos, one for each concentration, are provided in the "Insilico_videos" folder. Videos in higher quality are available upon request.
